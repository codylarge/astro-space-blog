_Gravity, the force that governs the movement of celestial bodies and influences the dynamics of our everyday lives, has been a subject of fascination and inquiry for centuries. Its nature has been a point of extensive exploration and debate among scientists and theorists._

### Isaac Newton

For centuries, Sir Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation stood as the prevailing explanation for gravity. Newton described gravity as an attractive force that exists between any two masses. According to his law, the force of gravity is directly proportional to the product of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This concept worked exceptionally well for describing the gravitational interaction between large bodies like planets, stars, and moons.

### Einstein

With the advent of Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, a new understanding of gravity emerged. General relativity represents gravity not as a force but as the curvature of spacetime caused by massive objects. According to this theory, objects with mass distort the fabric of spacetime, causing smaller objects to move in curved paths around them. Gravity, in the context of general relativity, isn't a force transmitted between objects but rather the result of the warping of spacetime caused by mass and energy.

Einstein showed us that this warping effects space just as much as it does time, meaning regions of higher gravity have increased time dialation. This means that if you entered a region of extreme gravity, a day experienced by you under that gravity could be years or centurys on earth.
