In a _measly_ 5 billion years, the Sun will enter a transformative phase as it exhausts its nuclear fuel. It will evolve into a red giant, slowly expanding and engulfing the inner planets over hundreds of millions of years.

Following the red giant phase, the Sun will shed its outer layers, forming a **planetary nebula,** while the core left behind will collapse into a dense, Earth-sized object known as a white dwarf.

## This is the crab nebula located just 6500 light years from earth

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
