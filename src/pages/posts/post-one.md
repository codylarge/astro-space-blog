In a _measly_ 5 billion years, the Sun will enter a transformative phase as it exhausts its nuclear fuel. It will evolve into a red giant, slowly expanding and engulfing the inner planets over hundreds of millions of years.

Following the red giant phase, the Sun will shed its outer layers, forming a **planetary nebula,** while the core left behind will collapse into a dense, Earth-sized object known as a white dwarf.

## This is the a planetary nebula located just 6500 light years from earth

A nebula is a vast cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium, and other ionized gases scattered throughout space, often they are the remnants of dead stars. These clouds act as stellar nurseries, where new stars are born. The Crab Nebula, also known as Messier 1, was formed from the remnants of a supernova explosion observed by Chinese astronomers in 1054 AD. The Crab Nebula is expanding at a rate of about 1,500 kilometers per second. It emits radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, making it a prominent source of energy visible to telescopes. This image in particular was assembled from 24 individual telescopes over 20 years ago.

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
